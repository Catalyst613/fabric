START OF WRITING KNOWLEDGE

`Most Important Rule that Must Always Be Followed:`

- Ensure the modified text includes all of the original semantics from the input before any text is output.

`Write in the active voice:`

The active voice eliminates confusion by forcing you to name the actor in a sentence. This construction makes clear to the reader *who* is to perform the duty.

The passive voice makes sentences longer and roundabout. *Who* is responsible is much less obvious.

Passive verbs have a form of the verb to be plus the past participle of a main verb, "am, is, are, was, were, be, been", plus a main verb usually ending in "en" or "ed": "was received"; "is being considered"; "has been selected."

The passive voice reverses the natural, active order of English sentences. In the following passive
example the receiver of the action comes before the actor:

Passive: The regulation [receiver] was written [verb] by the drafter [actor].

Active: The drafter [actor] wrote [verb] the regulation [receiver].

Passive constructions are confusing. Active sentences must have actors, but passive ones are complete without them: "The material will be delivered." (By whom?); "The start date is to be decided." (By whom?); "The figures must be approved." (By whom?)

Putting the actor before the verb forces you to be clear about responsibility: "The messenger will deliver the material."; "The contractor will decide the start date."; "The administrator must approve the figures."

Use the passive voice when the actor is unknown, unimportant, or obvious: "Small items are often stolen."; "The applications have been mailed."

`Use action verbs:`

use "consider" vs. "give consideration to"
use "applies to" vs. "is applicable to" 
use "pay" vs. "make payment"
use "recognize" vs. "give recognition to"
use "concerns" vs. "is concerned with"
 
They are called "nominals" --nouns with verbs inside. They are hard to read and make sentences
longer. Action verbs are shorter and more direct.

`Use "must" instead of "shall":`

"shall", imposes an obligation to act, but may be confused with prediction of future action.
"must", imposes obligation, indicates a necessity to act.
"must not", indicates a prohibition.
"may" indicates discretion to act
"will" predicts future action.
"should" infers obligation, but not absolute necessity.

To impose a legal obligation, use "must."
To predict future action, use "will."

DON'T SAY: *The Governor shall approve it.*

SAY: *The Governor must approve it.* [obligation]
or
SAY: *The Governor will approve it.* [future action]

`Be direct:`

Talk directly to the readers. Use the imperative mood. Regulations lend themselves to this style,
especially procedures, how-to instructions, and lists of duties.

Directness avoids the passive voice:

SAY: *Sign all copies.*
SAY: *Attach a copy of your W-2 to your return.*

This style results in procedures that are shorter, crisper, and easier to understand.

`Use the present tense unless specifically refering to a past or future context.`

`Write positively:`

If you can accurately express an idea either positively or negatively, express it positively.

DON'T SAY: *The Governor may not appoint persons other than those qualified by the Personnel Management Agency.*

SAY: *The Governor must appoint a person qualified by the Personnel Management Agency.*

A negative statement can be clear. Use it if you're cautioning the reader: "Don't run."; "No Smoking."

But avoid several negatives in one sentence:

DON'T SAY: *A demonstration project will not be approved unless all application requirements are met.*

SAY: *A demonstration project will be approved only if the applicant meets all requirements.*

It's better to express even a negative in positive form:

- use "dishonest" vs. "not honest"
- use "forgot" vs. "did not remember"
- use "ignored" vs. "did not pay any attention to"
- use "left the meeting" vs. "did not remain at the meeting"

`Use the singular noun rather than the plural noun:`

To the extent the meaning allows, use a singular noun instead of a plural noun. This will avoid the
problem of whether the rule applies separately to each member of a class or jointly to the class as a
whole.

DON'T SAY: *The guard will issue security badges to the employees who work in Building D and Building E.*

SAY: *The guard will issue a security badge to each employee who works in Building D and each employee who works in Building E.*

unless you mean: *The guard will issue a security badge to each employee who works in both Building D and Building E.* (There are other possible meanings.)

`Use parallel structure for lists:`

Arrange sentences so that parallel ideas look parallel. This is important when you use a list.

*Nonparallel construction*

The duties of the Executive Secretary of the Administrative Committee are:
- To take minutes of all the meetings; (phrase)
- The Executive Secretary answers all the correspondence; and (clause)
- Writing of monthly reports. (topic)

*Parallel construction:*

- To take minutes of all the meetings;
- To answer all the correspondence; 
- To write the monthly reports.

`Prefer simple words:`

Legal writing should be dignified, but doesn't have to be pompous. Writing can be dignified when the language is simple, direct, and strong. To make your writing clearer and easier to read -- and thus more effective -- prefer the simple word:

- use "make" vs "construct" or "fabricate"
- use "end" vs. "terminate"
- use "allow" vs. "afforded an opportunity"
- use "large part" vs. "substantial portion"
 
`Omit needless words:`

Don't use compound prepositions and other wordy expressions when the same meaning can be conveyed with one or two words.

- use "since" vs. "because of the fact that"
- use "remind you" vs. "call your attention to the fact that"
- use "for" vs. "for the period of" 
- use "often" vs. "in many cases"
- use "sometimes" vs. "in many instances" 
- use "like" vs. "in the nature of"
- use "his failure" vs. "the fact that he had not succeeded"
- use "whether" vs. "the question as to whether"

`Avoid redundancies:`

Don't use word pairs, if the words have the same effect or where the meaning of one included the other.

Avoid:
- any and all
- authorize and direct
- cease and desist
- each and every
- full and complete
- order and direct
- means and includes
- necessary and desirable

`Avoid "noun sandwiches":`

Avoid using too many noun clusters -- groups of nouns "sandwiched" together. Avoid
these confusing constructions by using more prepositions:

DON'T SAY: *Underground mine worker safety protection procedures development.*

SAY: *Development of underground procedures for the protection of the safety of mine workers.*
or
SAY (more likely): *Development of procedures for the protection of the safety of workers in underground mines.*

Which meaning is intended becomes clearer when this four-word sandwich is broken up.

`Use short paragraphs:`

Improve the clarity by using short, compact paragraphs. Each paragraph should deal with a single, unified topic. Lengthy, complex, or technical discussions should be presented in a series of related paragraphs.

`Write "Point First":`

Point first writing, more than anything else, will improve the clarity and persuasive of the writing. 

- State the point or proposition before developing or discussing it.
- Give the context before discussing the details.

At the beginning of the paragraph, tell the reader what topic or idea you are going to discuss in the rest of the paragraph. Try to restrict each paragraph to one main idea or topic. Then, in the first sentence or two of each paragraph, articulate the point of the paragraph, usually the conclusion. The remainder of the paragraph will discuss and elaborate on it, support it, or qualify it.
